maths_project
=============

A third year maths project for a four year mathematics and computer science degree. I may provide a makefile at some point, but in order to run everything in this repo you'll need to take the HiddenMarkov library from CRAN, swap out the Viterbi.mmpp.R, fiddle with Viterbi.R to make it actually call Viterbi.mmpp.R, and install a bunch of libraries at the top of the .py files. I think Rpy2 was also broken, so that might need fixing. Oh, and you'll need some tengwar font packages.

Yeah, alright, I need proper instructions for this...
