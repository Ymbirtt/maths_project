Check mmpp model is in fact valid - look at differences in times between events in each state, plot histogram, put exponential graph on top of it

Test results with more iterations of Baum-Welch (steal BlueCrystal, run on
Jormungandr, leave it overnight), and try more states (15?)

Stratify by day of week, look at data, average per day, histograms, etc etc

Fit markov model to weekdays and weekends, look for massive parameter differences

Two-sample Kolmogorov - Smirnov test on Monday vs Tue-Sun, Tue vs Mon, Wed-Sun, etc
