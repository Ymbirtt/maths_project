We conclude, then, in a swarm of negative results, but with an as yet unwritten algorithm, source code to execute it, and exactly one statistically valid result for an as yet unsolved problem. Further refinements can, of course, be made. Various path finding algorithms can probably be adapted for a CTMC to give the most likely sequence of states between two known endpoints, which would allow us to find the modal transition time between states and create a more accurate MMPP Viterbi. We could even try various other processes.

I hope that this project has shone a light into what was once a dark area, and that the resulting methods prove useful to others. Now that we have a plausible model of human behavior, it may be possible to use it as a background model against which anomalies can be detected. This may have applications such as bot net detection within computer networks. All source code used for this project, as well as the \LaTeX \, used to generate this document and svgs of most of the graphics are hosted on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/Ymbirtt/maths_project}. If you, for instance, had difficulty seeing some of the diagrams, or want more concrete information on exactly what happened in this project, I'd recommend finding it all there.
